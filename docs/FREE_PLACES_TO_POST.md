---

## Zero or low barrier (post soon)

| Place | Link | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Product Hunt** | [producthunt.com/launch](https://www.producthunt.com/launch) | Free. New accounts wait **7 days** before posting, or sign up for the PH newsletter for earlier access. You post your own product. Need: name, tagline, 240×240 logo, 2+ gallery images (1270×760), first comment with your story. |
| **Hacker News – Show HN** | [news.ycombinator.com/submit](https://news.ycombinator.com/submit) | Free. Title: `Show HN: Resume Comparison Engine – compare 2–5 resumes side-by-side (no signup)`. Technical audience; genuine “I built this” posts do better than ads. |
| **BetaList** | [betalist.com/submit](https://betalist.com/submit) | Free. For new/beta products. Need: custom landing page (not a template), email signup. Review can take a few weeks. |
| **StartupBase** | [startupbase.io/submit](https://startupbase.io/submit) | Free. Login with Twitter/LinkedIn/Facebook. Product must be public, own domain, decent design. For products launched in the last year. |
| **AlternativeTo** | [alternativeto.net](https://alternativeto.net) | Free. Add your product as an “alternative” to existing tools (e.g. resume screening tools). Good for SEO and people searching for alternatives. |
| **SaaSHub** | [saashub.com](https://www.saashub.com) | Free submission. They also have a [list of 100+ directories](https://www.saashub.com/submit/list) you can use to find more free places. |
| **BetaPage** | [betapage.co](https://betapage.co) | Free to submit. Early adopters and beta testers. |
| **Launching Next** | [launchingnext.com](https://www.launchingnext.com) | Free startup directory. |
| **Indie Hackers** | [indiehakcers.com](https://www.indiehackers.com) | Free. Post in “Share your project” or “Share your startup.” Works best when you’re an active member (comment, help others) before promoting. One strong “I built X, here’s what I learned” post often does better than many promo posts. |

---

## Reddit (free, but follow rules)

Most subs require **some history** or **no pure self-promo**. Best approach: be helpful first, then share your product when it fits.

| Subreddit | Approx. rules / tips |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **r/SideProject** | Among the most open to “I built this.” Post a working link, short context (what it does, why you built it), and reply to comments. No karma listed, but having a bit of history helps. |
| **r/AlphaAndBetaUsers** | For people looking for testers. Post your tool and ask for feedback. |
| **r/IMadeThis** | For things you made. Keep it about the build and the story. |
| **r/Entrepreneur** | Mix of advice and promotion. Share learnings or “launched X, here’s what happened” rather than a bare link. |
| **r/startups** | Read sidebar; many require participation before promotion. |
| **r/recruiting** | For recruiters. Be useful (e.g. “free tool I use for comparing resumes”) and follow sub rules. |
| **r/humanresources** | HR audience. Same idea: helpful context + link when allowed. |
| **r/promote** | Lower traffic but allows promotion. |

**Reddit tips:** Use a normal username (not “ResumeEngine_Official”), post Saturday morning (EST) on r/SideProject, and reply to every comment. One genuine “I built this and would love feedback” post per sub is better than spamming.

## Review / comparison sites (free listing, good for SEO and trust)

| Place | Link | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|
| **G2** | [g2.com](https://www.g2.com) | Free to create/claim a product profile. Reviews and rankings help visibility. |
| **Capterra** | [capterra.com](https://www.capterra.com) | Free basic listing. Part of Gartner (GetApp, Software Advice). One profile can cover multiple sites. |
| **GetApp** | [getapp.com](https://www.getapp.com) | Same as above; claim your product. |
| **Software Advice** | [softwareadvice.com](https://www.softwareadvice.com) | Same family; free listing. |

Submit your product and add your link; ask early users to leave a short review when they’re happy.

---

## HR / recruiter communities (free to join, share when relevant)

Good for **feedback and early users**; avoid hard selling.

| Community | Notes |
|-----------|--------|
| **Hacking HR** (Slack) | HR and HR tech. Look for #hrtech or similar and share when someone asks for tools. |
| **PeoplePeople** (Slack) | 10k+ members, recruiting and talent. Be helpful first. |
| **Resources for Humans (RfH)** (Slack) | HR leaders. #talent-acquisition is relevant. |
| **OneReq Community** (Slack) | Talent acquisition and recruiting ops. |
| **Unnanu Recruiters Community** (Slack) | Recruiters; no selling/lead gen, but sharing a free tool for feedback is usually fine if it fits the conversation. |

Search “Hacking HR Slack,” “PeoplePeople Slack,” etc. to find join links. Introduce yourself and your tool when it naturally fits a thread (e.g. “tool for comparing resumes”).

## Other free options

| Place | Notes |
|-------|--------|
| **LinkedIn** | Free. Post as yourself: “I built a free tool to compare 2–5 resumes. Would love feedback from hiring managers and recruiters.” Use hashtags like #hiring #recruiting #HRtech. |
| **Twitter/X** | Free. Same idea: short post + link. Tag relevant accounts if it’s a fit. |
| **Facebook Groups** | Search “hiring managers,” “recruiters,” “HR professionals.” Join, follow rules, share when the group allows. |
| **Quora** | Answer questions like “How do I compare resumes?” and mention your tool where it’s a genuine answer (follow Quora’s policies). |
| **Crunchbase** | Free company profile. Good for credibility. |
| **Wellfound (AngelList)** | Free startup profile. |

4. **r/SideProject** – One post with story + link + “would love feedback.”  
5. **BetaList + StartupBase** – Submit and wait for review.  
6. **G2 / Capterra** – Claim your product and add your URL.  
7. **One LinkedIn post + one Twitter post** – Same message: built this, would love feedback.  
8. **One HR Slack** – Join, be helpful, then share your tool when it fits.

## Why some places say “no” or limit you

- **Reddit:** Karma/age rules reduce spam. Build a bit of history (comments, one or two non-promo posts) in a sub before posting your product.  
- **Indie Hackers:** They favor active members. Comment and help others first; then “Share your project” is more likely to get a good response.  
- **Product Hunt:** 7-day wait for new accounts is to limit abuse; it’s still free.

None of the options above require paying to submit; the “cost” is time (building a bit of trust and following each place’s rules).

## One template you can reuse

**Short pitch (Product Hunt tagline, Reddit, LinkedIn, Twitter):**  
*“Resume Comparison Engine – compare 2–5 resumes side-by-side with smart ranking. No signup. Built for hiring managers and recruiters. Would love your feedback.”*  
+ your link.

Use this in directories, Reddit, and social posts; adjust length per platform.
