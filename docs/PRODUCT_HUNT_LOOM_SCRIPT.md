# Product Hunt Loom Video Script (1–2 minutes)

Use this when recording your Loom for the Resume Comparison Engine launch. Keep it casual; one take is enough.

---

## Before you start

- **Tool:** [Loom](https://www.loom.com) (browser extension or desktop app). Free tier is fine.
- **Length:** Aim for **1–2 minutes**. Product Hunt viewers skip long demos.
- **Screen:** Record your **screen only** (no face needed unless you want to). Or screen + small face cam.
- **Browser:** Open your product in a clean tab: your live URL (e.g. `resumemaster-ten.vercel.app` or your custom domain). Have 2–3 PDF resumes ready in a folder (or use sample resumes).

## Script (say something like this while you show the steps)

**[0:00–0:15] Intro (on your homepage or upload page)**  
> "Hey, I'm [your name]. This is Resume Comparison Engine—you can compare 2 to 5 resumes side-by-side in one place, no signup. I'll show you the basics in under a minute."

**[0:15–0:35] Optional: job description**  
> "If you have a job description, paste it here so the tool can score candidates against it. If not, you can skip and still get a structured comparison."  
*(Paste 2–3 lines of sample JD or skip.)*

**[0:35–0:55] Upload**  
> "Upload between 2 and 5 resumes—PDF or Word. I'll add a few."  
*(Drag or select 2–3 files. Click through to 'Generate insights' or the main CTA.)*

**[0:55–1:15] Results**  
> "In a few seconds you get a ranked comparison—who fits best, side-by-side attributes, and you can see how we rank so it's not a black box."  
*(Scroll briefly: ranking, table, maybe the 'How we rank' or confidence section.)*

**[1:15–1:30] Export (optional)**  
> "You can export everything to Excel for your hiring team. And that's it—no account required."  
*(Click export if it's quick; otherwise just mention it.)*

**[1:30–1:45] Close**  
> "Link is in the description. Would love your feedback—what would make this a daily tool for you? Thanks."  
*(Optional: show the URL in the address bar or a simple end card.)*

## Tips

- **One tab:** Only your product; close other tabs and notifications.
- **One take:** Don’t redo for small mistakes. Short and real beats polished and long.
- **Audio:** Quiet room; built-in mic is fine. Say the link at the end or put it in the Loom description.
- **Paste the Loom link** into your Product Hunt launch in the "Video / Loom" field.

## Optional end card (if you want)

You can open a simple Notepad or slide with:

```
Resume Comparison Engine  
[your URL]

Compare 2–5 resumes. No signup.  
Thanks for watching — would love your feedback.
```

Show it for 5–10 seconds at the end, then stop the recording.
